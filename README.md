## Overview
This repository contains a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, implemented in **C++**. The code is well-organized, modular, and designed to provide clarity and reusability for anyone who wants to use or understand the underlying principles.

Each section includes a README file explaining the specific data structure or algorithm, use cases, and example inputs and outputs.

## Compile and run

g++ <filename>.cpp -o abc
/.abc
