# Thread-Safe Market Data Processor

A high-performance, thread-safe market data processing system designed for High-Frequency Trading (HFT) applications.

## Features
- Multi-threaded market data processing
- Thread-safe data structures
- Lock-free operations where possible
- Real-time data processing
- Performance monitoring
- Memory-efficient design

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Producer-Consumer Pattern
- Implemented in the Queue class for thread-safe data transfer
- Producers (market data feeds) add data to the queue
- Consumers (worker threads) process data from the queue

### 2. Thread Pool Pattern
- Manages a pool of worker threads
- Efficiently handles concurrent processing
- Reduces thread creation/destruction overhead

### 3. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Smart pointers for resource management
- Automatic cleanup of resources
- Exception-safe design

### 4. Observer Pattern
- Market data updates can be observed by multiple components
- Decoupled data processing from data consumption

### 5. Singleton Pattern (for global configurations)
- Thread-safe configuration management
- Global access to system settings

## OOP Concepts Implemented

### 1. Encapsulation
- Private data members with public interfaces
- Thread-safe access to internal state
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Inheritance
- Base classes for common functionality
- Interface inheritance for polymorphism

### 3. Polymorphism
- Virtual functions for extensible behavior
- Template-based generic programming

### 4. Abstraction
- Clean interfaces hiding implementation details
- Modular design for easy maintenance

## HFT-Specific Concepts

### 1. Low Latency Design
- Lock-free algorithms where possible
- Memory pool for reduced allocation overhead
- Cache-friendly data structures

### 2. Market Data Processing
- Real-time price and volume tracking
- Order book maintenance
- Market impact analysis

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Zero-copy data transfer
- Memory alignment for cache efficiency
- SIMD instructions for parallel processing

### 4. Risk Management
- Position tracking
- Exposure monitoring
- Circuit breakers

## Issues Fixed and Solutions

### 1. Namespace Ambiguity
- **Issue:** Ambiguous references to `MarketData` in main.cpp and test files
- **Solution:** 
  - Removed `using namespace MarketData` directives
  - Used fully qualified names (e.g., `MarketData::Processor`)
  - Ensured clear namespace resolution

### 2. Deprecated C++ Features
- **Issue:** Use of deprecated `std::result_of` in ThreadPool
- **Solution:** 
  - Replaced with modern `std::invoke_result`
  - Updated template parameter syntax
  - Improved type deduction

### 3. Move Semantics
- **Issue:** Incorrect move constructor/assignment operator declarations
- **Solution:**
  - Explicitly deleted move operations where not needed
  - Fixed move semantics in ThreadPool and Processor classes
  - Ensured proper resource management

### 4. Thread Safety
- **Issue:** Potential race conditions in data processing
- **Solution:**
  - Implemented proper mutex locking
  - Used atomic operations for flags
  - Added thread-safe queue implementation

### 5. Test Case Behavior
- **Issue:** Inconsistent expectations in StopAndStart test
- **Solution:**
  - Updated test to match implementation behavior
  - Clarified that data added while stopped is ignored
  - Improved test documentation

## Requirements
- C++17 or higher
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Thread support
- Google Test (for testing)

## Building the Project
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running Tests
```bash
cd build
./MarketDataProcessorTest
```

## Usage Example
```cpp
#include "Processor.h"

int main() {
    // Create processor with 4 worker threads
    MarketData::Processor processor(4);
    processor.start();
    
    // Add market data
    processor.addData(MarketData::MarketData("AAPL", 150.0, 100));
    
    // Get statistics
    double lastPrice = processor.getLastPrice("AAPL");
    int totalVolume = processor.getTotalVolume("AAPL");
    
    processor.stop();
    return 0;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Lock Contention
- Fine-grained locking
- Lock-free algorithms where possible
- Reader-writer locks for concurrent access

### 2. Memory Management
- Custom allocators for reduced fragmentation
- Memory pools for fast allocation
- Cache-aligned data structures

### 3. Thread Pool Tuning
- Optimal thread count based on CPU cores
- Work stealing for load balancing
- Priority-based processing

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Thread Safety
- Use thread sanitizer for detection
- Implement proper synchronization
- Avoid deadlocks with lock ordering

### 2. Performance Issues
- Profile with perf or gprof
- Monitor cache misses
- Check for false sharing

### 3. Memory Issues
- Use address sanitizer
- Monitor memory fragmentation
- Implement proper cleanup

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular design
- Consistent naming conventions

### 2. Error Handling
- Exception safety
- Proper error propagation
- Logging and monitoring

### 3. Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for system behavior
- Performance benchmarks

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more market data types
- Implement advanced order types
- Add machine learning capabilities
- Enhance monitoring and analytics
- Support for distributed processing
